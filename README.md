Automates tweets at the times the Georgia Tech whistle sounds

Let me know if the schedule is wrong at any point!

Notes:

- "Images" holds the original images and modified ones for use in the account as well as a document linking to their sources.
- "Automation" holds the script that is run as a service on the Raspberry Pi as well as instructions explaining how it works.
- "config.json" is largely empty but is filled out on the Raspberry Pi for security reasons.
